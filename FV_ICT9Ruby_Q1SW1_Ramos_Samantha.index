	<p style="color: black;">Volleyball is a sport that has 2 teams (6 players each), in this sport you have to have good strategies, teamwork, and agility. I love and I am also passionate about, it helps me stay fit and is also a passtime for me, whenever I am bored. I hope that in the future, I can pursue my career in volleyball in schools like: </p>
	<ul>
		<li>Ateneo de Manila University</li>
		<li>De La Salle University</li>
		<li>University of Santo Tomas</li>
		<li>University of the Philippines</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Or if ever I do not join these schools, I would want to join UAAP or PVL.</p>
	</ul>

	<p style="font-weight: bold; color: mediumpurple;">Ran takahashi</p>
	<p>He is 22 years old and has already participated in 2 olympic volleyball games. He is my favorite volleyball player, since he is really good at many positions like:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Libero</li>
		<li>Outside Hitter</li>
		<li>Middle Blocker</li>
	</ol>
	<p>He is nice to his fans and loves to interact and take picture with them, he usually has meet and greets in Italy and Japan, since he is training in teams from both countries. </p>
	<br>
	<p>Volleyball is an amazing sport with great people on each and every team, always trying their best in every game.</p>
